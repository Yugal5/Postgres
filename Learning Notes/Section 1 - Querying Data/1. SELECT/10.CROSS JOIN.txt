Different from other join clauses such as LEFT JOIN  or INNER JOIN, the CROSS JOIN clause does not have a join predicate.

Suppose you have to perform a CROSS JOIN of two tables T1 and T2.

If T1 has n rows and T2 has m rows, the result set will have nxm rows. For example, the T1 has 1,000 rows and T2 has 1,000 rows, the result set will have 1,000 x 1,000 = 1,000,000 rows.

The following illustrates the syntax of the CROSS JOIN syntax:


SELECT select_list
FROM T1
CROSS JOIN T2;

The following statement is equivalent to the above statement:

SELECT select_list
FROM T1, T2;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS T1;
CREATE TABLE T1 (label CHAR(1) PRIMARY KEY);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS T2;
CREATE TABLE T2 (score INT PRIMARY KEY);

INSERT INTO T1 (label)
VALUES
	('A'),
	('B');

INSERT INTO T2 (score)
VALUES
	(1),
	(2),
	(3);
	
	
SELECT *
FROM T1
CROSS JOIN T2;

Summery: 

For Cross Join, we can say that all the fileds from Left table will get seperate row with Right side table.
