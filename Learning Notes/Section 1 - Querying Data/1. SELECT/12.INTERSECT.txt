Like the UNION and EXCEPT operators, the PostgreSQL INTERSECT operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

The INTERSECT operator returns any rows that are available in both result sets.


## Syntax :

SELECT select_list
FROM A
INTERSECT
SELECT select_list
FROM B;


To use the INTERSECT operator, the columns that appear in the SELECT statements must follow the folowing rules:

The number of columns and their order in the SELECT clauses must be the same.
The data types of the columns must be compatible.


SELECT select_list
FROM A
INTERSECT
SELECT select_list
FROM B
ORDER BY sort_expression;

## Explain --

We can't assure order of select query so in case if you want data to be in a specific order then we have to use ORDER BY at end of query.


SELECT *
FROM most_popular_films 
INTERSECT
SELECT *
FROM top_rated_films;

## Explain --

With this we will get only one Unique record which is similar in both the tables.
