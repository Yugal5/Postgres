Syntax : 

SELECT
	select_list
FROM
	table_name
ORDER BY
	sort_expression1 [ASC | DESC],
        ...
	sort_expressionN [ASC | DESC];


PostgreSQL evaluates the clauses in the SELECT statment in the following order: FROM, SELECT, and ORDER BY.

SELECT
	first_name,
	last_name
FROM
	customer
ORDER BY
	first_name ASC;
	
## Expalin --

Here bco of  'first_name ASC' data displayed in alphabatical order like A-Z for column first_name.


SELECT
	first_name,
	last_name
FROM
	customer
ORDER BY
	first_name;

## Expalin --

	Even though if we didn't specify ASC it will take ASC as by default.

SELECT
       first_name,
       last_name
FROM
       customer
ORDER BY
       last_name DESC;
	   
## Expalin --

Here we can see data will be ORDER By last_name , based on the result of this first_name column will be change.

SELECT
	first_name,
	last_name
FROM
	customer
ORDER BY
	first_name ASC,
	last_name DESC;
	
## Expalin --

Here we can see data fetch based on both columns so it will order by column first_name and then sort column last_name.

C  -  A
C  -  B
D  -  A
D  -  B


SELECT 
	first_name,
	LENGTH(first_name) len
FROM
	customer
ORDER BY 
	len DESC;


## Expalin --

We can also use ORDER BY with the predefine funtions of a postgres , in above exampl we calculated LENGTH of first_name and use alais for t as len.
Then we order it by len , which will show length of that first_name and sort according to it.



-- create a new table
CREATE TABLE sort_demo(
	num INT
);

-- insert some data
INSERT INTO sort_demo(num)
VALUES(1),(2),(3),(null);


SELECT num
FROM sort_demo
ORDER BY num;

SELECT num
FROM sort_demo
ORDER BY num NULLS LAST;

SELECT num
FROM sort_demo
ORDER BY num NULLS FIRST;

SELECT num
FROM sort_demo
ORDER BY num DESC;

SELECT num
FROM sort_demo
ORDER BY num DESC NULLS LAST;	


## Expalin --

With above all examples , NULL can be arrannge with the help of NULLS LAST and NULLS FIRST.


Summary:
Use the ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement to sort rows.
Use the ASC option to sort rows in ascending order and DESC option to sort rows in descending order. The ORDER BY clause uses the ASC option by default.
Use NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST options to explicitly specify the order of NULL with other non-null values.
