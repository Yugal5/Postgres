## Syntax : 

SELECT
   select_list
FROM
   table_name;
   
The FROM clause is optional. If you do not query data from any table, you can omit the FROM clause in the SELECT statement.


SELECT first_name FROM customer;

-- Here we gave only one column name i.e. first_name.

SELECT
   first_name,
   last_name,
   email
FROM
   customer;
   
-- Multiple column selection from same table.
   
   
SELECT * FROM customer;

-- Selection of all columns.

SELECT 
   first_name || ' ' || last_name,
   email
FROM 
   customer;

-- Here we can use || '  ' || to join two colums over the select query.   


SELECT 5 * 3;

-- As FROM clouse is optional we are not fetching data from table , so above query will return us 15.
