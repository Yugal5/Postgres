## INNER JOIN  -- It fetch records which are commmon in both of the tables.
				  It checks equal records from both the tables , if match it pull all columns in display result.

SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
INNER JOIN basket_b
    ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
	

## LEFT JOIN  -- Compare both tables , if match then pull this record into display.
				 By default it pull all records from Left table and mark columns of Right table to NULL.

SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
LEFT JOIN basket_b 
   ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
   
## RIGHT JOIN -- The right join is a reversed version of the left join. The right join starts selecting data from the right table.
                 It compares each value in the fruit_b column of every row in the right table with each value in the fruit_a column of
				 every row in the fruit_a table.

				If these values are equal, the right join creates a new row that contains columns from both tables.

				In case these values are not equal, the right join also creates a new row that contains columns from both tables. However, it fills the columns in the left table with NULL.

SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
RIGHT JOIN basket_b ON fruit_a = fruit_b;


## FULL OUTER JOIN - The full outer join or full join returns a result set that contains all rows from both left and right tables,
					 with the matching rows from both sides if available. 
					In case there is no match, the columns of the table will be filled with NULL.

SELECT
    a,
    fruit_a,
    b,
    fruit_b
FROM
    basket_a
FULL OUTER JOIN basket_b 
    ON fruit_a = fruit_b;
