Table aliases temporarily assign tables new names during the execution of a query.


## Syntax : 
table_name AS alias_name;

## Useful scenario to use Table with Alias name : 

A) In case table name is very lenghty.
B) Using table aliases in join clauses.
C) Using table aliases in self-join.

A) In case table name is very lenghty : 
	Consider if tables name is very lenghty so it may impact on readibility of query.
	So it is always recommended to use alias for this names.
	
	a_very_long_table_name.column_name.
	
	a_very_long_table_name AS alias
	
	alias.column_name

B) Using table aliases in join clauses:

	table_name.column_name
	
	SELECT
	c.customer_id,
	first_name,
	amount,
	payment_date
FROM
	customer c
INNER JOIN payment p 
    ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
ORDER BY 
   payment_date DESC;
   
   
C)  Using table aliases in self-join :

SELECT
    e.first_name employee,
    m .first_name manager
FROM
    employee e
INNER JOIN employee m 
    ON m.employee_id = e.manager_id
ORDER BY manager;
