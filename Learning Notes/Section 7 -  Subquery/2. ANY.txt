ANY is used to compared a value to set of values retured by Subquery.

## Syntax :

expresion operator ANY(subquery)

## Points to remember : 

The subquery must return exactly one column.
The ANY operator must be preceded by one of the following comparison operator =, <=, >, <, > and <>
The ANY operator returns true if any value of the subquery meets the condition, otherwise, it returns false.


IMP :   Note that SOME is a synonym for ANY, meaning that you can substitute SOME for ANY in any SQL statement.


SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE length >= ANY(
    SELECT MAX( length )
    FROM film
    INNER JOIN film_category USING(film_id)
    GROUP BY  category_id );


## Explain --

Here actual execution will start from sub-query. First it will fetch all MAX Lenght movies from the film_category and film table.
Then it will be used with the outer query in where condition and that query will output the data whichever movie is having length >= ANY output.

Note : In above example we can use SOME also without any issue and it will return the same output without any error.
	   If the subquery does not return any rows, the entire query returns an empty result set.


ANY vs. IN

The = ANY is equivalent to IN operator.

SELECT
    title,
    category_id
FROM
    film
INNER JOIN film_category
        USING(film_id)
WHERE
    category_id = ANY(
        SELECT
            category_id
        FROM
            category
        WHERE
            NAME = 'Action'
            OR NAME = 'Drama'
    );
	
	
	
SELECT
    title,
    category_id
FROM
    film
INNER JOIN film_category
        USING(film_id)
WHERE
    category_id IN(
        SELECT
            category_id
        FROM
            category
        WHERE
            NAME = 'Action'
            OR NAME = 'Drama'
    );
