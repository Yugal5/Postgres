WHERE condition
RETURNING (select_list | *)

# Above query is used to create table and insert multiple records.

DELETE FROM links
WHERE id = 8;

# It will delete from links where id = 8.

DELETE FROM links
WHERE id = 10;

# If we don't have condition match for deletion it will not through error but query executes without anything.

DELETE FROM links
WHERE id = 7
RETURNING *;

# Returns whole row after deletion of id 7.

DELETE FROM links
WHERE id IN (6,5)
RETURNING *;

# We can also delete multiple rows from the where condition as well with the help of IN.


DELETE FROM links;

# Without where clause it will delete everythng from the table.

# Summary :
	
	Use the DELETE FROM statement to delete one or more rows from a table.
