### Expalin --

With above example we are fetching the record just unique values from the column bcolor.



SELECT
	DISTINCT bcolor,
	fcolor
FROM
	distinct_demo
ORDER BY
	bcolor,
	fcolor;
	

### Expalin --

With above example we are fetching the record which are possible combination of column bcolor and column fcolor.
Possible unique pair will be bring ammong them.


SELECT
	DISTINCT ON (bcolor) bcolor,
	fcolor
FROM
	distinct_demo 
ORDER BY
	bcolor,
	fcolor;
	
## Expalin --

With above example we are fetching the record unique from the bcolor and with that first output that may be based on order by.
But here no. of records fetch will depends on unique value in column bcolor.
