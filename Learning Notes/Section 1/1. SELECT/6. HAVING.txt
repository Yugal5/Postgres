The HAVING clause specifies a search condition for a group or an aggregate. 
The HAVING clause is often used with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups or aggregates based on a specified condition.

SELECT
	column1,
	aggregate_function (column2)
FROM
	table_name
GROUP BY
	column1
HAVING
	condition;
	
##  HAVING vs. WHERE

The WHERE clause allows you to filter rows based on a specified condition. 
However, the HAVING clause allows you to filter groups of rows according to a specified condition.


In other words, the WHERE clause is applied to rows while the HAVING clause is applied to groups of rows.

SELECT
	customer_id,
	SUM (amount)
FROM
	payment
GROUP BY
	customer_id
HAVING
	SUM (amount) > 200;

SELECT
	store_id,
	COUNT (customer_id)
FROM
	customer
GROUP BY
	store_id
HAVING
	COUNT (customer_id) > 300;
